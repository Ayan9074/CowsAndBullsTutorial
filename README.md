# CowsAndBullsTutorial
Cows and Bulls is a game like Mastermind used in a GCSE question. This is the code on how to complete a slightly more complicated version.
Please note that this is slightly more complicated as instead of having all numbers are different I made it so numbers could repeat which means you have to add more theory to the for loop.
